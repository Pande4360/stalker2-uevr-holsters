# STALKER 2 UEVR Plugin

A plugin for UEVR (Unreal Engine VR) that enhances the VR experience in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.

## Current Features

- Fixed weapon origin alignment to ensure bullets shoot correctly from the muzzle position
- Basic VR implementation for weapon handling

## Work in Progress

Currently, the plugin is in early development with limited functionality. The following features are pending implementation:

### Priority Tasks

1. Weapon FOV & Animation Handling
   - Either prevent animations from changing weapon FOV
   - OR implement forced scope state changes when animation state is frozen to final position

2. Scope Implementation
   - Add foveated screen capture in front of scope to provide proper zoomed experience in VR

## Installation

1. Install UEVR following the official instructions from [UEVR's website](https://uevr.io)
2. Install this plugin according to UEVR's plugin installation guidelines

## Known Issues

- Limited feature set as this is an early development version
- Scope functionality not yet fully implemented
- Weapon FOV may be affected by animations

## Contributing

This is a work in progress project. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
